# Maze-Solver-with-Stacks
This project uses a Stack data structure to solve a maze. The user provides x,y coordinates to explore certain directions
until it reaches a dead end of the goal. If it reaches a deadend, the Stack manually keeps track of the coordinates previously visited
so we can backtrack to a certain point. I created this project for my Intermediate Python class in Spring 2023.
